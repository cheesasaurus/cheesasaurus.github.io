  <div class="stackedit__html"><p>People love fresh wipes. But why? After 7k hours played, I want to share the 3 big problems I see causing churn on PVP worlds:</p>
<h3 id="progression-differences-having-too-big-of-an-impact-on-pvp.-gear-jewels-blood-potions-and-passives-all-play-into-this.">1. Progression differences having too big of an impact on pvp. Gear, jewels, blood, potions, and passives all play into this.</h3>
<ul>
<li>It’s not fun to fight somebody who does twice as much damage, has twice as much health, twice as much shields, and heals twice as fast. And vice versa. Some asymmetry is fine but the difference between e.g.  vs  is too extreme.</li>
<li>In regards to power difference, there are 3 phases of world lifecycle:
<ol>
<li>The world recently started. For any given player, the pool of  is 100% of the population.</li>
<li>The world has been running long enough to establish a wide range of progression. For any given player, the pool of  is far less, probably something like 15% of the population.</li>
<li>The world has been running long enough that most of the remaining population has reached the progression limit. Like 90% of the population are within similar power to each other, and freshly-joined players have no fun fights available.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The community meta for addressing gear difference is a level-gap rule (e.g. no attacking people &gt;10 levels under), but this has all kinds of problems.
<ul>
<li>Levels are too crude an approximation for measuring power and can also be gamed via twinking (e.g. 100% blood with red twins, bone armor, no amulet. Versus someone with a merc copper weapon. Similar level, but hardly comparable in power).</li>
<li>The materials needed at endgame are the same materials needed at midgame. So either lvl 90 Chad has to stand by and watch lvl 60 Timmy take the stuff he needs, or we have “hot spots” and Timmy is stuck at level 60 complaining about gatekeeping.</li>
<li>It discourages progression. Lvl 79 Timmy knows that lvl 90 Chad has full BIS jewels, full BIS weapons, etc. Why the hell would Timmy want to get lvl 80 and be steamrolled by Chad?</li>
<li>It doesn’t solve the issue where the pool of  is only a small portion of the population.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="increasing-player-sparsity-as-the-world-progresses.-aka-theres-40-people-online-but-where-the-hell-is-everybody">2. Increasing player sparsity as the World progresses. aka “there’s 40 people online, but where the hell is everybody???”</h3>
<ul>
<li>When the world wipes, everybody is doing things in Farbane and you get a lot of interactions with a variety of people.</li>
<li>As progression difference widens, the pool of people who need the same things (bosses, mats) as you drastically decreases.</li>
<li>The farther you progress, the larger the variety of materials you need. The chance that you bump into somebody further decreases.</li>
<li>The farther apart castles are, the less chance you bump into somebody heading home with loot.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="finish-your-chores-before-you-can-play.-fun-activities-are-locked-behind-unfun-activities.">3. “Finish your chores before you can play”. Fun activities are locked behind unfun activities.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fun: PVP. Unfun: Farming repair mats to restore durability</li>
<li>Fun: Raiding. Unfun: farming materials to craft golems and bombs</li>
<li>Fun: Defending a raid. Unfun: farming materials to craft servant gear</li>
<li>Fun: Building my castle. Unfun: farming materials to do it</li>
<li>“Keeping up with the Joneses”
<ul>
<li>Fun: Balanced PVP. Unfun: farming mats to craft gear</li>
<li>Fun: Balanced PVP. Unfun: rifts</li>
<li>Fun: Balanced PVP. Unfun: farming schematics</li>
<li>Fun: Balanced PVP. Unfun: farming materials to craft potions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When is farming unfun?</p>
<ul>
<li>unfun: farming uncontested</li>
<li>unfun: trying to farm but contested by players with large power difference</li>
<li>FUN: farming, contested by players with similar power<br>
Issue #3 (doing chores) seems to largely be a consequence of issues #1 (power difference) and #2 (player sparsity).</li>
</ul>
<p>What makes rifts unfun? Fighting in Brighthaven (Silverlight city) felt fun, what’s the difference?</p>
<ul>
<li>unfun: killing mobs uncontested</li>
<li>unfun: getting killed by players with large power difference</li>
<li>unfun: getting disabled by mobs (different from Brighthaven)</li>
<li>unfun: taking massive damage from mobs (different from Brighthaven)</li>
<li>unfun: losing fights and getting nothing during the 25 minute window (different from Brighthaven)</li>
<li>unfun: winning fights but getting nothing because you spent the 25 minutes fighting (different from Brighthaven)</li>
<li>unfun: killing somebody but they respawn right next to you before the fight is over. (different from Brighthaven).<br>
Regardless of whether you’re winning or losing fights, the 25 minute window, on an inconvenient schedule, is a problem.<br>
The Brighthaven map design might be a little better for pvp too but I can’t really put my finger on why.</li>
</ul>
<p>“The materials needed at endgame are the same materials needed at midgame”</p>
<ul>
<li>Solving the root of issue #1 (power difference) flips this around from being a problem, into being a solution to help with issue #2 (player sparsity).</li>
</ul>
